          <div class="half-width">
            <p>I recognize the importance of quality website design to allow my clients to effectively tell their stories across media platforms. My content creation enables businesses to weave a clear and compelling brand narrative that drives business and leaves their audiences wanting more. I approach each project as an opportunity to develop a relationship, and to help that relationship grow through a powerful online presence.</p>
            <p> Through my work in various client service and project management roles, I have learned the importance of listening closely to my client's needs, adhering to a tight timeline, </p>

          <div class="half-width">
            <p> and creative problem solving to deliver quality results fast with a lasting impact. </p>
            <p> I'm currently keeping my team on track as an Account Coordinator in the advertising industry. I also like to flex my creative muscles in my down time by learning new crafts such as yoga, macrame, and sewing, or enjoying the outdoors by hiking through the fresh mountain air. I'm a wicked cook, somewhat of a beer snob, and will beat you in dominoes every time. </p>

              <h3> Hand-Coded HTML </h3>
              <p> My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

              <p> I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
